SM64DS version by Fiachra

http://kuribo64.net/

===========================

Stuff works similar to NDS homebrew projects.
Code goes in source/
Data goes in data/

Place a SM64DS EUR ROM in this folder (Other regions will NOT work)
Use a recent version of NSMB Editor to compile and insert the code into the ROM.

Included features:

HoverWithLimit.cpp - Allows Mario to hover for a set time limit by pressing both B and L.
Helper.cpp - Currently saves the Player object's address for use in the project, more will be added in future.
SM64DS.h - Defines several useful functions from the game. Not complete at all, I've just added stuff as I needed it.

Enjoy!
