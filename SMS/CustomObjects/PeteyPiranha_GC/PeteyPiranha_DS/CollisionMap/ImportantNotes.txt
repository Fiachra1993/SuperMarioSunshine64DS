need rz (y in Blender) 0.5 radians, approx. 28.6478898 degrees to account for 
rotation in original root bone of rz 0.5 radians
need rz (y in Blender) -90 degrees as collision map is then rotated on z 90 degrees, 
related to how model stored before transformations applied

(rz -61.3521102)

Above values wrong.

rz -40
