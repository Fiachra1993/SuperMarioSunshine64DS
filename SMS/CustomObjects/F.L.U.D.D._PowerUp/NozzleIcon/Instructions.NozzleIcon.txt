Note: You will require a hex editor which allows the block selection, copying and overwriting of data. I have used XVI32.

The image "HoseNozzle.bmp" is the F.L.U.D.D. icon that we want to display on the screen when F.L.U.D.D. is in use. It is 
a 32x16 indexed Bitmap image with exactly 16 colours in its palette. 

To insert it we are going to add it to an unused region of the following existing HUD image which will be loaded at all 
times during normal "Adventure" mode: 
NCG (tile data): 
Filename: /ARCHIVE/cee.narc/data/2D_cad/EUR/ENG/d_2d_upr_icon_E_ncg.bin
Size: 256x64
Bits per pixel: 4
Compression: LZ77 without header

NCL (palette):
Filename: /ARCHIVE/c2d.narc/data/2D_cad/EUR/d_2d_upr_icon_P_ncl.bin
Compression: None

The NCG format splits the image into a grid of 8x8 pixel tiles, left-to-right, top-to-bottom. This means that our nozzle 
image occupies 4x2 tiles. We're going to replace tiles 12-15 and 44-47 with rows 0-3 and 4-7 respectively of our converted 
nozzle image.

Each tile contains for each pixel its colour, stored as in index into the colour palette. NCG 
images which use 8 bits per pixel may have a palette of up to 256 colours whereas those which use 4 bits are limited to 
just 16 at a time. Rather than have each 4 bpp image have only a single 16 colour palette, the palette may have up to 
16 "rows" each containing 16 colours and different parts of the image will be displayed with different palette rows.

The image "d_2d_upr_icon_E_ncg.bin" has 7 palette rows. We could add an additional row but to save space we'll overwrite 
the unused 5th row. 

To import the nozzle: 
1. Extract the decompressed NCG and its NCL palette
-- Open your SM64DS ROM in SM64DSe
-- Select the tab "SM64DS File System" and navigate to "/ARCHIVE/cee.narc/data/2D_cad/EUR/ENG/d_2d_upr_icon_E_ncg.bin"
-- Click on "LZ Force Decompression" followed by "Extract (Raw)", saving the file as "d_2d_upr_icon_E_ncg.decompressed.bin"
-- Navigate to and extract "/ARCHIVE/c2d.narc/data/2D_cad/EUR/d_2d_upr_icon_P_ncl.bin", saving the file as "d_2d_upr_icon_P_ncl.bin"

2. Convert HoseNozzle.bmp
-- Select the "Levels" tab with SM64DSe, select any level and click on "Edit level"
-- Click the "Minimap" button to open the Minimap and Image Editor
-- Under "Graphic NCG" enter the filename "data/2D_cad/EUR/ENG/d_2d_upr_icon_E_ncg.bin" and uncheck "Decompress"
-- Under "Palette NCL" enter the filename "data/2D_cad/EUR/d_2d_upr_icon_P_ncl.bin"
-- Under "Screen NSC" ensure that no filename is entered and uncheck "Decompress"
-- Enter a "Width" of "32" and a "Height" of "16"
-- Under "Bits Per Pixel" select "4"
-- Leave "Palette Row (4 bpp Only) at "0"
-- Uncheck "Is Minimap"
-- Click on "Import" and select the image "HoseNozzle.bmp"
-- Ignore any settings in the "Import Image 4BPP" window which opens upon selection and click "Import"
-- Close the "Import Image 4BPP" window
-- You should see the "HoseNozzle" image displayed correctly within the minimap/image editor

3. Export the generated NCG and NCL files
-- Within the main SM64DSe window select the "SM64DS File System" 
-- Navigate to and extract "/ARCHIVE/cee.narc/data/2D_cad/EUR/ENG/d_2d_upr_icon_E_ncg.bin", saving the file as "hose_nozzle_ncg.decompressed.bin"
-- Navigate to and extract "/ARCHIVE/c2d.narc/data/2D_cad/EUR/d_2d_upr_icon_P_ncl.bin", saving the file as "hose_nozzle_ncl.bin"

4. Merge the NCG files
-- Make a copy of the exported "d_2d_upr_icon_E_ncg.decompressed.bin" and name it "d_2d_upr_icon_E_ncg.hose_nozzle.decompressed.bin"
-- We want to replace tiles 12-15 and 44-47 (inclusive) of "d_2d_upr_icon_E_ncg.hose_nozzle.decompressed.bin" with tiles 0-3 and 4-7 (inclusive) 
of "hose_nozzle_ncg.decompressed.bin". We first need to calculate the offsets of these tiles: each tile contains 64 pixels and each pixel 
occupies 4bits so to calculate a tile's offset use ((index * 64) / 2) where index is the zero-based tile index. We can then calculate that we 
need to overwrite bytes 384-511 and 1408-1535 of the original images with bytes 0-127 and 128-255 (inclusive) from the nozzle icon respectively.
-- Open "hose_nozzle_ncg.decompressed.bin" in XVI32
-- Select the data by clicking on 0x00, hitting Ctrl+B then doing the same for 0x7F. Navigate to and select "Edit > Clipboard > Copy as hex string".
-- Open "d_2d_upr_icon_E_ncg.hose_nozzle.decompressed.bin" in XVI32
-- Navigate to and select "Edit > Overwrite string..."
-- Select "hex String", paste the string copied to the clipboard and hit "OK"
-- In a similar manner copy bytes 128-511 from "hose_nozzle_ncg.decompressed.bin" and overwrite bytes 1408-1535 of 
"d_2d_upr_icon_E_ncg.hose_nozzle.decompressed.bin"
-- Save your changes to "d_2d_upr_icon_E_ncg.hose_nozzle.decompressed.bin"

5. Merge the NCL files
-- Make a copy of the exported "d_2d_upr_icon_P_ncl.bin" and name it "d_2d_upr_icon_P_ncl.hose_nozzle.bin"
-- We want to replace the 5th row, row index 4 of "d_2d_upr_icon_P_ncl.bin" with the palette from our nozzle icon. Each palette row 
contains 16 colours and each colour is stored using 16 bits (2 bytes). The offset of the 5th row is therefore (4 * (16 * 2)) 128. 
The nozzle icon has exactly 16 colours which means 1 row. We therefore want to replace bytes 128-159 of "d_2d_upr_icon_P_ncl.bin" with 
bytes 0-32 (inclusive) of "hose_nozzle_ncl.bin".
-- Similarly to as was done in step 4, overwrite bytes 128-159 of "d_2d_upr_icon_P_ncl.hose_nozzle.bin" with bytes 0-32 of 
"hose_nozzle_ncl.bin"
-- Save your changes to "d_2d_upr_icon_P_ncl.hose_nozzle.bin"

6. Import the merged image
-- Within SM64DSe, select the "SM64DS File System" tab within the main window
-- Navigate to "/ARCHIVE/cee.narc/data/2D_cad/EUR/ENG/d_2d_upr_icon_E_ncg.bin" and replace it with "d_2d_upr_icon_E_ncg.hose_nozzle.decompressed.bin"
-- SM64DS expects "d_2d_upr_icon_E_ncg.bin" to be compressed using LZ77 without a header so click on "LZ Force Compression"
-- Export "d_2d_upr_icon_E_ncg.bin", saving the file as "d_2d_upr_icon_E_ncg.hose_nozzle.compressed.bin" so you can re-import without having to 
worry about compression
-- Navigate to "/ARCHIVE/c2d.narc/data/2D_cad/EUR/d_2d_upr_icon_P_ncl.bin" and replace it with "d_2d_upr_icon_P_ncl.hose_nozzle.bin"

7. Verify
-- Open the minimap/image editor 
-- Under "Graphic NCG" enter the filename "data/2D_cad/EUR/ENG/d_2d_upr_icon_E_ncg.bin" and check "Decompress"
-- Under "Palette NCL" enter the filename "data/2D_cad/EUR/d_2d_upr_icon_P_ncl.bin"
-- Under "Screen NSC" ensure that no filename is entered and uncheck "Decompress"
-- Enter a "Width" of "256" and a "Height" of "64"
-- Under "Bits Per Pixel" select "4"
-- Set "Palette Row (4 bpp Only) to "4"
-- Uncheck "Is Minimap"
-- Click on "Load Image"
-- You should the nozzle icon correctly displayed near the middle of the first row

Done.
