Note: I used Blender v2.70a to export the models

- Open FLUDDAndLuigi.blend in Blender and export to DAE, ensuring that the "Include Material Textures" option is selected

You will need to make some manual changes before the exported DAE model can be imported: 
- Replace the entire <library_visual_scenes>.<visual_scene id="Scene" ...>.<node id="Armature" ...> node in your exported model with 
the <library_visual_scenes>.<visual_scene id="Scene" ...>.<node id="luigi_all_root" ...> node found in FLUDDSkeletonLuigi.DAE. This 
replaces the node matrix transformations with the individual scale, rotation and translation components as required by SM64DSe.
- Replace the absolute texture filenames within <library_images>.<image>.<init_from> tags with their relative locations
- Add the following <extra> to <library_effects>.<effect id="mat_body-effect">.<profile_COMMON>: 
<extra>
	<technique profile="SM64DSe">
		<lights>1 0 0 0</lights>
		<environment_mapping>0</environment_mapping>
		<double_sided>0</double_sided>
		<tex_tiling>flip flip</tex_tiling>
		<tex_scale>1 1</tex_scale>
		<tex_rotate>0</tex_rotate>
		<tex_translate>0 0</tex_translate>
		<fog_enable>0</fog_enable>
	</technique>
</extra>
This will apply the same material settings as in the original BMD model (see "ExportedOriginalModels/luigi_model.dae" for reference).
- Add the following <extra> to <library_effects>.<effect id="Water-effect">.<profile_COMMON>: 
<extra>
	<technique profile="SM64DSe">
		<double_sided>1</double_sided>
	</technique>
</extra>
This will make the water material double-sided once imported into SM64DS.

Your model should now be ready to import. I have included "FLUDDAndLuigi_Ready.dae" as a reference for how the final DAE model should look.
- Open your ROM in SM64DSe
- Select any level and click on "Edit level"
- Select "3D model" along the top followed by "Import other model" on the left-hand side
- Select the model "/ARCHIVE/arc0.narc/data/player/luigi_model.bmd"
- Un-check "Generate collision map", set "Texture Quality Setting" to "Best Quality" and check "Vertically Flip All Textures"
- Click on "Open" along the top and select your exported DAE model
- Set the "In-Game Size Preview" to "0.008" and confirm that your model looks as expected
- Click "Import"

Next we need to fix Luigi's Power Flower texture animation to remove the reference to his translucent texture which 
no longer exists. This will prevent the game from crashing upon picking up a Power Flower (Luigi's texture will remain the same).
- Click on "Texture and BTP Editor" in the top right-hand corner
- Click on "Load BTP" and select "/ARCHIVE/arc0.narc/data/player/L_tx_bodytrans.btp"
- Remove all frames, materials, textures and palettes using their respective "-" button
- Click on "Save BTP"
You should end up with L_tx_bodytrans.btp being the same as the included "L_tx_bodytrans_Empty.btp".

Finally we need to replace Luigi's waiting animation with Mario's so that F.L.U.D.D. is not intersecting with Luigi's head: 
- Within the main SM64DSe window click on the "SM64DS File System" tab
- Navigate to "/ARCHIVE/arc0.narc/data/player/wait.bca"
- Click on "Extract (Raw)" and save the exported file on to your file system
- Navigate to "/ARCHIVE/arc0.narc/data/player/L_wait.bca"
- Click on "Replace (Raw)" and select the exported "wait.bca" file

Done.
